# Identify and describe the ruby method you implemented. 
# for sorting the array, I had a lot of trouble. My answer isn't technically correct, since (according to the test) I should have converted all array items to strings, but then I couldn't get the sort to work, since "2" doesn't fall into the alphabet. My code returns the same output, but the values for numbers remain integers and NOT strings. 
#
#for sorting the hash, since the value is the last number stored in the hash, I did some googling and found out you can sort_by &:last, which was a simple an effective solution.
